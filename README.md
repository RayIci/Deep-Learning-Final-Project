# Deep Learning Final Project: Text to Image Synthesis with Generative Adversarial Networks

This is the final project for the Deep Learning exam for University of Genova. This projects
aim to get a better and deeper understanding on how text to image synthesis with Generative Adversarial Networks works.

The paper from which this laboratory is inspired is [Generative Adversarial Text to Image Synthesis](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/generative-adversarial-text-to-image).

## What do you find in this project

In this project you will find the final implementation of the networks presented in the paper and a notebook file explaining the done experiments.

## How to run the project

To run the app make sure that you have `Docker` installed on you computer (if not [Docker link here](https://www.docker.com/)).
With docker engine up and running execute the following command:
