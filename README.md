# Deep Learning Final Project: Text to Image Synthesis with Generative Adversarial Networks

This is the final project for the Deep Learning exam for University of Genova. This projects
aim to get a better and deeper understanding on how text to image synthesis with Generative Adversarial Networks works.

The paper from which this laboratory is inspired is [Generative Adversarial Text to Image Synthesis](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/generative-adversarial-text-to-image).

## Project Structure

 - examples Folder : ipynb files useful to understand how the net and the data are pre-processed and trained.
 - Paper Folder : It containes the original Paper file and the short Report.
 - src Folder : it contains all the code that has been produced.
