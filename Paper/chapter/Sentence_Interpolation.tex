\section*{Sentence Interpolation}

Although ground-truth text descriptions are not 
available for the interpolated points, 
the generated images appear visually coherent 
and plausible. 
\\
By holding the noise distribution constant, 
the only variable factor across each row is 
the text embedding. 
\\
This approach allows interpolations to accurately 
capture content-related changes, 
such as a bird transitioning from blue to red, 
while preserving consistent pose and background 
elements.
\\
In addition to sentence interpolation, 
Figure 8 (Right) presents results achieved 
through noise interpolation. 
\\
In this case, two random noise vectors are sampled, 
and by keeping the text embedding fixed, 
we interpolate between these noise vectors. 
\\
The resulting images display a smooth style 
transition while maintaining fixed content. 
\\
This demonstrates the model's ability to 
disentangle style and content effectively, 
enabling independent manipulation of each aspect 
to produce seamless variations in generated 
images.
