\section*{Introduction}

In 2016, the ability of an AI system to generate realistic and 
coherent images from textual descriptions 
(such as "small red bird with a blue beak") was a current issue and 
far from being achieved.
It should be noted that it's necessary to use natural language 
and domain-specific attributes to describe the image to be generated.
