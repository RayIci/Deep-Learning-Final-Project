\subsection*{Pose and Background Style Transfer}

GAN-INT-CLS, when combined with a trained style 
encoder (as described in the Style Transfer 
subsection), enables style transfer from an unseen query 
image to a new text description. 
\\
Remarkably, this approach often retains intricate 
background details, such as a tree branch on which 
the bird is perched, showcasing the effectiveness
of disentangling style and content.
\\
The ability of GAN-INT-CLS to disentangle style is 
particularly noteworthy as it facilitates a 
straightforward method of generalization. 
\\
By leveraging this disentanglement, the model can 
combine previously observed content 
(e.g., text descriptions) with previously seen styles 
in novel pairings, thereby generating realistic 
and plausible images that are entirely distinct from 
those seen during training. 
\\
Another pathway for generalization involves utilizing 
attributes present in the training data
(e.g., "blue wings" and "yellow belly") to create new 
combinations.
