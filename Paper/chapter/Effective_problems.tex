\section*{Effective Problems}
The paper highlights an intrinsic problem: when trying to generate images from textual descriptions, 
there are many different configurations that can be correct. ( Multi-modal Problem ). 
And even the reverse task, that is, generating descriptions from images, is difficult, 
but it is easier because it can be handled by predicting one word at a time, 
based on what has already been generated and the image itself.
